This project investigates Supervised Machine Learning techniques such as Logistic Regression.

This folder contains 2 files:

Iris.csv:
* Dataset used for the program. Obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv

LogisticRegression:
* This program creates a classifier that predicts whether an iris belongs to the class 'Iris-setosa' or not.
* Class 'Iris-setosa' is encoded as '0', and class 'Not Iris-setosa' is encoded as '1'.
* The data is split into Training and Test sets.
* The logistic regression model is created and trained. Predictions are performed on the Test set.
* A confusion matrix is plotted, and code is written to calculate the accuracy, precision and recall of the model.
