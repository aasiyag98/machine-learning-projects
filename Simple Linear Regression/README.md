LinearRegression.ipynb:
* This program looks at the effects of Age and BMI on Insurance Costs.
* A scatter plot is created with the 'Age' data as the independent variable and the 'Charges' data as the dependent variable.
* A linear regression model is built and fitted to the data.
* Predictions are then made on the data and a line of best fit is plotted over the scatter plot.
* The process is then repeated with the 'BMI' data as the independent variable.
