This personal project investigates Unsupervised Learning techniques such as Clustering.
You will find 3 files in this folder:

Iris.csv:
* Dataset used for these programs. Obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv

Clustering I (K-Means Model):
* This program uses the 'Iris.csv' dataset.
* This program plots 6 scatter graphs with the different combinations of variables to determine which set of variables looks most promising for separating the data into clusters.
* Two of these scatter graphs are selected and a K-Means model is built and trained on these features.
* The accuracy of the model is analysed by finding the models Silhouette Score.

Clustering II (Dendrogram):
* This program also uses the 'Iris.csv' dataset.
* This program uses 2 features from the data set to print 4 dendrograms, each with a different combination of linkage methods and distance metrics.
* One of the dendrogram plots are selected and a Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithm is ran using the same parameters as the selected dendrogram.
* The accuracy of the model is analysed by finding the models Silhouette Score.
